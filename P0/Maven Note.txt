The Surefire plugin was added to the Bank pom in order to generate test results from the Junit tests
created for the app. If you are looking to get started with generating test reports for your
unit and integration tests then all you need to do is add the plugin to the POM, and Maven should do
the rest. If your IDE test runner does not trigger the plugin you can use the command "mvn test" to do
so.
