        Since we don't have access to an SQL database we can use a List to store
        user information for the time being. Lists are like more flexible arrays: you
        have access to the contiguous storage and index access, but they can also
        be resized if more resources need to be added.

        Keep in mind this list will reset every time the application stops and restarts,
        so we can set the constructor to provide starting data for us whenever the
        InMemoryUser dao is created
