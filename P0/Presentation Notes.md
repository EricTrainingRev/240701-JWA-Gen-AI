# Presentation Notes
## Presentation requirements
- limit the presentation to 5 minutes
- a live demo of your application must be included
- before and after views of the tables in your database should be included
- your github repository needs to hold your up to date code for your project

## Order of operations
1. introduce yourself
2. showcase implemented requirements
    - include before and after visuals of your SQLite database tables
3. showcase any stretch goals you implemented or started implementing
4. field questions

## Recommended order to showcase requirements
I recommend the following order in showing off the business and software requirements of the application:
- Users should be able to register with the bank
    - Users should have unique usernames
    - Usernames and passwords should not be longer than 30 characters
- Users should be able to securely access the bank portal
- Users should be able to open new checking accounts with the bank
- Users should be able to view account details for their checking accounts
    - Users should only be able to see and access accounts they have created with the bank
- Users should be able to deposit and withdraw money from their checking accounts
    - Bank accounts should not be able to drop below $0
- Users should be able to close checking accounts with the bank

## General recommendations
- write down what you are going to say and use it as a script during your presentation
- set up your database with pre-made data to streamline your presentation
- create a presentation roadmap for yourself you can follow during your presentation
- practice your presentation
    - get in groups and practice together to get used to showcasing your work
- be proud of what you have created
- write down what you are going to say and use it as a script during your presentation
- time yourself when you practice your presentation: aim to finish showcasing the application by the 4 minute mark
- don't stop the live demo to showcase your source code: it should be available for review in your github repository
