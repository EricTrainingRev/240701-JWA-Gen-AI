# LLM Introduction Study Guide

## Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- Artificial Intelligence
    - the use of technology to mimic cognitive functions only humans posses
        - reasoning
        - understanding
        - learning
        - problem solving
    - a broad term that has many specific implementations
        - image recognition
        - conversation
        - pattern recognition
        - image generation
- Machine Learning
    - subset of of AI
    - large data sets are analyzed to help the AI tool respond to user input
        - image generation tools use large image data sets that are tagged with descriptors to generate images for users
        - conversant tools use large collections of conversations to determine how to respond to user input
        - data analysis tools use large collections of data points to find trends in batch data
    -  the general rule is the more data in the data set, the "better" the model becomes

## Large Language Models
Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundation models built on large datasets that include a wide array of information, making them excellent "foundations" to build more specialized tools upon. In the case of LLMs, these models are designed to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) in order to analyze user input and return a suitable response, which is determined by the data set the model was trained on. Some examples are:
- Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT)
    - GPT models use the transformer architecture improve response time and quality to user input
    - typically "trained" via next word prediction, which makes this kind of model good at generating context relevant sentences in response to queries
- Biderctional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT)
    - BERT models are designed to assist with esoteric language tasks such as sentiment analysis, summarization, and determining intended meaning for words that can have multiple meanings
    - BERT models are commonly used in research publications
    - typically "trained" to do both next word prediction and next sentence prediction
- Claude
    - an AI model designed to read, analyze, and offer suggestions and advice on writing
- Llama
    - an LLM designed for NLP tasks that is available for commercial and research use
    - created and updated by Meta
- Github Copilot
    - an code completion tool trained on github data designed to provide auto completion assistance for code
- Codeium
    - an LLM designed to assist programmers with development work
    - it provides both chat and code completion features
- ChatGPT
    - one of the most popular LLMs in the world
    - an all purpose tool, for most virtual assistants use cases ChatGPT can usually provide some form of assistance

## General Use Cases For Consumers
- Content Generation
- Virtual Assistant
- Summarization tool
- Sentiment Analysis
- Textual Analysis
- Chatbot

## LLM Best Practices
- Understand the limitations of the model you are using
- Use specific prompts when possible
- Don't put sensitive information in your prompts
- Verify information returned from the model you are using
