# User Acceptance Testing
User Acceptance Testing is a process of reporting on difficult (or impossible) to quantify topics. These can be things like:
- is an application enjoyable to use?
- is an application intuitive to use?
- is an application nice to look at?
- does the application inspire confidence?
- etc.

There is a level of subjectiveness to answers for these questions: this not a bad thing. In fact, it is ideal to have a wide spread of individuals with different interests, ways of thinking, actual interest in your product, etc. By covering a wide array of individuals and getting their feedback on your application you make it more likely that you will catch intangible issues with your application. 

One of the main things when collecting or providing UAT feedback is that the feedback needs to be meaningful: take the following to examples of user feedback about whether the planetarium is "inviting, inspires interest":
- User Acceptance Tester 1:
    - feedback: I don't like planets
- User Acceptance Tester 2:
    - feedback: I don't like planets, and this application did not build any new interest in learning more about planets

Tester 1 technically answered the question, but didn't give us much else to work with. Tester 2 not only answered the question but gave an answer that included information the development team could act on if desired (adding more features to entice those not inclined to the cosmos to try the website out anyways).
