# Testing Documentation

## Test Plan (wide)
Any testing endeavor should have a starting point, or at least a central source of truth when it comes to the details of a testing project. On the documentation side this document is called the Test Plan. This document can contain:
- Test Strategy
- Test Objectives
- Test Schedule
- cost estimates
- effort estimates

Whether or not the above resources are included or not, a Test Plan should include information about the team, the scope of testing, what is being tested, contact info for the product owner, and any other necessary logistical details for completing the testing project.

## Test Strategy (narrow)
If a Test Plan is broad, a Test Strategy is a narrow document that is specific to one or more Testing Objectives. This can include information such as the software needed to perform testing, personnel assignments, schedules, work estimates, reporting strategies, and other logistical details specific to one or more related Test Objectives. 

## Test Schedule
A Test Schedule is used to plan and track work on a testing project. When a schedule is present it provides details for the testing team on what work needs to be accomplished and what the deadlines are for the work.

## Requirements Specification
Requirement Specification documents are used to list out in detail the requirements of an application:
- Software Requirements detail the needs of the application and/or testing you are doing that are uniquely software related
- Business Requirements detail the needs of the application and/or testing you are doing from the perspective of the client you are testing for
- Testing Requirements detail the testing specifications for the application and/or testing you are meant to perform

Keep in mind that Requirements documents can come in all sorts of styles: any kind of requirement for doing your work, whether related to the application, specific testing techniques, logistical needs, etc., should be stored in some kind of Requirements Specification documentation

## Requirements Traceability Matrix
A Requirements Traceability Matrix maps the relationship between User Stories and Requirements, which can then be used to help determine how to go about creating meaningful Test Cases. The way it does this is by grouping User Stories with their associated Acceptance Criteria. Acceptance Criteria is the steps that must be completed in order for a User Story to be fulfilled.

## Test Progress Report
A Test Progress Report is used to track progress on the testing work being done, and is typically associated or included in a Test Schedule. This provides a quick and easy look into how work is progressing that can help with decision making both during the testing work and for future projects

## Test Summary Report
When all the testing is done, defects have been discovered, and requirements have been verified, all the data needs to be aggregated in some way, shape and form. A Test Summary is one or more documents used to inform relevant parties of the work that has been done, results of the testing, and any next steps that are recommended or going to be completed in the next round of work
