    /*
        If primitive types are your basic building blocks, non-primitive
        types are how you actually craft meaningful
        collections of data for your user.

        We've already seen the most common of reference types: classes.
        These resources are going to be your bread and butter while
        working with Java: you will define what data you are working with
        inside your classes (both primitive and reference types) and then
        create objects of those classes to do things with that data

        Interfaces are another type of reference: these resources are like
        "contracts" that tell your application what kind of actions and
        properties the class should have. If a class implements an interface
        then the class will have the resources associated with that interface

        Enums are a convenient way of storing static values and referencing
        those static values in a consistent way.

        Arrays are basic data structures that allow you to store data in your code and
        then reference later
