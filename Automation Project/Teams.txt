1. Come up with team name

2. Collect Github information so everyone on the team can be added to the team repo when it is made

3. create git repository for group project
	- I recommend creating it locally first in a fresh Maven project
	- Just make the initial repo

4. create remote git repository and link local repo to remote repo

5. break before we set up Jira boards
