    <!-- Many web pages will have some kind of header to announce what is on the page -->
     <h1 id="Something">This is a very large header</h1>
     <h6 id="Something">This is a much smaller header</h6>
     <!-- 
        All elements we can define in our html are either going to be in-line or block elements
        If an element is a block element (like the headers above) then the default behavior of the
        browser is to render the content on a new line. On the other hand, if your elements are
        in-line elements then they will be rendered on the same line 
     -->
    <input type="text" id="Something"><input type="text" id="Something">
     <!-- 
        Notice that these input tags don't have a second closing tag associated with them:
        Some tags like the header options above will require you to use opening and closing tags
        while others like inputs only need to initial tag to work properly
      -->

      <!-- 
        We can change attributes in our elements by setting new values for the attributes. For instance,
        input elements can have a specific type of data they are meant to work with indicated by setting
        the value of the "type" attribute. The text options above make it so we can enter any text input
        into the field, but the number option below only allows for numeric expression (there are a lot
        more types than just text, number, and file)
      -->
      <input type="number" id="Something">
      <input type="file">
    
      <!-- 
        There are an incredible amount of attributes you can apply to elements in a web page
        that can change the way the browser renders the content, but there are a few attributes that
        are going to be of primary interest for us

        id      -> this attribute is meant to be used to provide a unique identifier for the element
        name    -> this attribute is meant for internal identification, often when providing labels for your other elements
        style   -> this attribute is used to change the way the browser renders the content
        class   -> this attribute is used when you want one or more elements to share styling options or to be accessed as a group via JavaScript
      -->
    <label for="usernameInput">Please enter your username</label>
    <input type="text" name="usernameInput">
    <p style="text-align: center;">This holds text, the way the text is rendered is adjusted by the style attribute</p>
    <p class="InfoSection">This paragraph section is my info section</p>
